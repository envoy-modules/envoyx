# Envoy dynamic modules Rust SDK

This is the Rust SDK for the Envoy dynamic modules. The modules are shared libraries that can be loaded by the Envoy to extend HTTP filtering capabilities.

This SDK facilitates the creation of Rust-based shared libraries that can be loaded at multiple HTTP filter chain
in Envoy configuration. See the [example](./example) for more details.
